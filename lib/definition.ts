**What makes a great homily awesome?**
Great story that ties into the reeadings and applies to daily living
Personal application
Awesome Delivery 

**A great homily intersects:**
God’s life
The people’s life
My life

**Child-proofing homilies (It is difficult to compete with loud children in the congregation - so need to figure out a way to communicate amid the children - these tips will help):**
Short sentences
Short concepts (if it takes 3 paragraphs to explain a concept, then it’s too long)
Stories - present and punchy (simple plot with an arc and be able to fit on ½ to ⅔ of a page with 16 point font and quickly move through the arc to get to a simple conclusion)
3 pages maximum (at 16 point font); if it’s too long, it’s a losing battle with upset children

**Each homily should have at least 4 main components.**

Story (with or without an introduction) - The story can be local, as in something that happened at St. Leo or in the community or Diocese, or something that happened in the world. The important quality in a story is to try to create a memorable link between the readings to the points contained in the homily. Ordinarily, it is highly recommended to refrain from retelling one of the stories that was just told in the readings or Gospel. An idea on screenwriting: (https://www.amazon.com/Save-Last-Book-Screenwriting-Youll/dp/1932907009/ref=asc_df_1932907009/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=312139954763&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=2057178815925623245&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9033367&hvtargid=pla-404289642390&psc=1) 

**What are the qualities that make up a story?**
A story begins in a certain way. A story often begins with the phrase “Once upon a time…” or “In the year XXX,...” or “There was a lady named Susan…”
You paint a picture of a situation, which could be a person or character in a place and you provide some details about the context/location/situation
Something changes for the main character, usually there is an obstacle or challenge that they meet with. 
Then, due to a series of effects from the challenge, the situation is resolved for the good or bad of the character. 

**Not a story:**
The Council of Ephesus happened in the year 431.
At that Council, Nestorius was condemned as a heretic. 
He was teaching that Jesus became God only at the Resurrection.
Nestorius never reconciled with the Church.

**This is a story:**
In the year 431, Nestorius was a pastor in a parish near Carthage. He was teaching people at the parish that Jesus was born a man and only at the Resurrection did He become God. A few years later he was transferred to another parish in Carthage and was teaching the same thing. The people here, however, took issue with his teaching and told him he was wrong. Well, Nestorius did not comply with their pushback, so the issue was escalated to the Bishop. The Bishop called in Nestorius and asked him a series of questions. Nestorius was unable to answer the questions and so was excommunicated from the Church until he could repent and change his position. Nestorius never reconciled with the Church or changed his position and so went about teaching his own doctrine. Today we call this heresy Nestorianism. 


**Characteristics of a high quality Main point:**
The point is closely related to what is going on in the Scripture readings. It could be a point of theology or a point of morality or a point of Christian living. 
Next step/Application - This final component of the homily should provide an invitation for the listener to take the next step in being a disciple with Jesus or to implement some other Christian virtue or practice. In this last section, there should be a tie-in to the original story to bring the homily home. 


**An example of a well-written homily following the above method:**
Twenty-third Sunday in Ordinary Time

We have heard many times – be prepared. Be prepared for what you might ask? What about be
prepared in our faith? Be prepared to for those things not seen and for which we hope? In
essence, we need to be prepared to take the next steps. Many of us ask further what are those
next steps? Let me provide a story of faith, hope and next steps.

In a small town, they were having a severe drought. The local churches and leaders of
the community had a meeting and knew that where two or more are gathered in my name works
when praying for the same thing! They sent messages on social media, through email and texts
to all the families in the community to come together and bring any items that illustrate their
faith. All gathered at dusk as the sun was setting. The leaders looked across the community and
were astounded at the numbers of neighbors who came together to pray. Yet, one symbol of
faith, astounded the leaders. One small girl came forward and stood with the greatest show of
faith… an opened umbrella she carried.


Main Point: This little girl not only had faith to pray. She had expectation of the result and was
preparing for the next steps.


Point from Gospel: From Luke’s Gospel, we see a several concepts. One – “Whoever does not
carry his own cross and come after me cannot be my disciple.” We each have a cross to carry –
from a severe drought for a community to a personal cross that only God and you know. No
matter our cross, we can work to be prepared in our faith to take the next steps with God. Luke
gives examples of a construction project in which laying a foundation requires preparation or the
next steps cannot be finished.


Another Point from Readings: Next steps – from Wisdom – we know that we may not be able to conceive what God intends. We must have faith and be prepared for the next steps that God may share with us or not. We can listen through prayer.


Opportunity for Next Step: Encourage each of us to take 10 minutes this week to listen in
silence to God for His next step for your life. This is an act of being prepared. He may place
someone in your path as Onesimus was for Paul in the second reading. As we know where two
or more are gathered makes a difference. So, you might want to take that 10 minutes with
another person and sit in silence (and solidarity) for support of what God has for each other’s
next steps. Steady on.



**Core Purpose & Function**

What does your app actually do? What's the main problem it solves?
Homily.build is a creative web application designed to help Catholic preachers to quickly formulate an amazing homily for the parish.


Who is your target user and what's their context when using it?  Catholic priests, deacons and lay-people who preach at a liturgy, para-liturgy or other communal event.

What specific task or outcome should the AI accomplish within your app?  The AI should ask the user the questions so as to help them create an excellent homily using a particular set of readings according to the above mentioned paramaters for an excellent homily

**AI Role & Behavior**
The AI should be like a coach and assistant who is helping write a homily according to the current context, belief, and feeling of the priest, deacon, or lay-person.

**Tone and communication style** (professional, casual, encouraging, etc.)  The language should be at about the level of a 6th grader.  It should be accessible, use short sentences, and should be encouraging.

Should it be proactive or reactive in its interactions?  The ai should be proactive.


**Input & Output Specifications**

What kind of input will users provide? (text, data, images, etc.)  The user will provide the readings and the context of the group that they will be preaching to.

One example of a context is a Newman Center audience who are all university students and most of whom are Catholic.  Some of the students are exploring the faith.  

What format should responses take? (step-by-step instructions, summaries, code, etc.)  The AI should take into account the number of questions that the user wants to be asked in order to create an excellent homily.  The number of questions should be under 15 questions.


Context & Constraints

What domain knowledge or expertise does the AI need?  The AI should only give the user information that is consistent with the teachings of the Catholic Church.  Refer to the lives of the saints as the first source of storytelling.

What should it absolutely never do or say?  The AI should never return something contrary to the teachings of the church even if the user asks the AI to do so.


Integration Details

How does this fit into your app's user flow?  This process is the core functionality of homily.build which is the ai homily writing tool.
Will it need to reference user data, preferences, or history? no.
Should it integrate with other features or external services? no.

Success Metrics

How will you know if the prompt is working well?  If the user can create a homily without getting frustrated and in fewer than 20 clarification propmts, that will be success.
What would make users love (or hate) the AI interaction?  An accurate, streamlined, quick process will make the user love the interaction.



What Makes a Catholic Homily Excellent:

The Sacred Intersection
An excellent Catholic homily creates a powerful convergence where God's life, the people's life, and the preacher's life meet meaningfully. It bridges the eternal truths of Scripture with the lived reality of the congregation, making faith tangible and actionable.

The Three-Part Architecture
Every great homily follows a clear structure: a compelling Story that captures attention and creates connection, one focused Main Point drawn directly from the Scripture readings, and a practical Application that invites listeners to take concrete next steps in their discipleship journey.

The Power of Story
Exceptional homilies use stories as vehicles for truth. These aren't mere illustrations but carefully crafted narratives with clear beginnings, challenges or obstacles, and resolutions. The best stories are local, personal, or contemporary - creating memorable bridges between ancient Scripture and modern life. They avoid simply retelling biblical narratives and instead offer fresh perspectives that illuminate the readings.

Practical Accessibility
Outstanding homilies are "child-proofed" - designed to communicate effectively even amid distractions. This means short, punchy sentences; concepts that don't require lengthy explanations; and stories that move quickly through their arc to reach clear conclusions. The entire homily stays under 850 words and fits on three pages maximum.

Transformational Purpose
The ultimate measure of homily excellence isn't eloquence but transformation. Great homilies don't just inform - they invite. They conclude with specific, achievable invitations for listeners to grow in discipleship, implement Christian virtues, or engage in particular practices. The application circles back to connect with the opening story, creating a satisfying sense of completion.

Authentic Integration
Finally, excellent homilies feel authentic to both the preacher and the community. They reflect genuine wrestling with Scripture, honest personal reflection, and deep understanding of the congregation's needs and context. They respect the sacred responsibility of preaching while remaining approachably human.
